        <li>Add pork mince and brown on high heat, breaking the chunks apart with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Push the pork mixture to the rims of the pan, making room in the middle of the pan/wok. Add spicy doubanjiang and fry on medium heat to 'wake the spice' up, for about 1 minute. Add in chilli powder, sugar and Sichuan peppercorn (if using). Mix everything in the pan well.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and 1 cup of water. Mix well then gently add tofu cubes. Lift the pan/wok off the stove and gently swirl the pan to combine tofu with the pork sauce. Bring up to a boil then reduce heat to low and simmer (without a lid) for 3 - 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the thickening mixture, combine cold water with cornstarch and mix well. Pour the thickening mixture into the pan and gently swirl the pan to thicken the sauce and coat the tofu.</li>
