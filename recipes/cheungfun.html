    <h3>Cheung Fun, a soft and smooth rice noodle roll commonly served swweetend soy sauve, peanut sauce, and hoisin sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. </h3>

    <p>Rice noodle rolls, or Cheung Fun 腸粉, are a Chinese, Cantonese specifically, thin wide rice noodle that’s rolled up. They can be served filled with shrimp, beef, or other ingredients and also rolled up and served plain. Rice noodle rolls are served as a snack, small meal, or part of dim sum. They’re super popular in Hong Kong and all over the world. Rice noodle rolls are pure comfort food. If you’ve ever had dim sum, you’ve probably had rice noodle rolls. Rice noodle rolls are also the same as the rice noodles in chow fun, just cut up into noodles, instead of being rolled.
